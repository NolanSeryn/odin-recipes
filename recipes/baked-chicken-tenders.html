        <h1>Baked Chicken Tenders</h1>
        <img src="../images/baked-chicken-tenders.jpg" alt="A plate of crispy, baked chicken tenders.">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying!</p>
        <p>You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.</p>
            
        <p class="subheader">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2 strips</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups pank bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="subheader">Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray</li>
            <li>Crack egg in a shallow dish. Place dry ingredients into a large freezer bag and mix well</li>
            <li>Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place in panko mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
            <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
