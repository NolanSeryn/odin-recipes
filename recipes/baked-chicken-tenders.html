        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying!</p>
        <p>You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.</p>
